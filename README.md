First of all I'm really glad you to see here. This is my first C# project. So please excuse my mistakes. I'll improve this project, add some different languages (日本語, English), different themes, bluetooth, wi-fi or may will connect to a network but these all needs money. Also, I'll reduce the parts of arduino, I'll design my own circuitry to reduce costs of the device, but it takes time. And finally, I would be really thankful if you give me suggestions.
Thanks for your time again.
